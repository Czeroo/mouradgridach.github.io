I am a professor of Computer Science at Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco. My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision.

My main area of research is Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for classical texts as well as biomedical texts, Sentiment Analysis (SA), and other field of NLP. 

More recently, I started to focus on Computer Vision by first run some Final Projects with my undergraduate and graduate students. We focused on basic and classical applications in computer vision:

* Recognizing digits through MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks.

* Recognizing alphabets using Convolutional Neural Networks.

* Classifying images using CIFAR-10 dataset.
