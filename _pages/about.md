I am a Postdoctoral Research at the University of Colorado working with Professor Larry Hunter. I am the CEO and Founder of DeepAfricAI. Also, I am a professor of Computer Science at Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco. My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.

My main area of research is Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for classical texts as well as biomedical texts, Sentiment Analysis (SA), and other field of NLP. I am focusing on the development of deep learning techniques for natural language tasks such as Named Entity Recongition and Sentiment Analysis. Furthermore, I tried to see the effect of word representations on such applications.  

More recently, I started to focus on Computer Vision : as a start, we run some final projects with my undergraduate and graduate students. We highlighted some basic and classical applications in computer vision:

* Recognizing digits through MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks.

* Recognizing alphabets using Convolutional Neural Networks.

* Classifying images using CIFAR-10 dataset.
