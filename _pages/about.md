Mourad Gridach is a professor of artificial intelligence at Ibn Zohr University, Agadir, Morocco. He is teaching in both High Institute of Technology and National School of Applied Sciences both in Agadir. His research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning.

My main area of research is Computational Linguistics focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for classical texts as well as biomedical texts, Sentiment Analysis (SA), and other field of NLP. 

More recently, I started to focus on Computer Vision by first run some Final Projects with my undergraduate and graduate students. We focused on basic and classical applications in computer vision:
* Recognizing digits through MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks.
* Recognizing alphabets using Convolutional Neural Networks.
* Classifying images using CIFAR-10 dataset.
